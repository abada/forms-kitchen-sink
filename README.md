### Notes

This applet demonstrates how to use <input> elements with a pure-Meteor CRUD pattern.  It doesn't use form tags, and it doesn't auto-build a form using a JSON object.  It's intent is for the form builder who wants a high degree of granularity and control in builder his or her user interfaces.
